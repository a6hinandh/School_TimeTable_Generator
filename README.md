## 🧠 Problem Statement

Creating school timetables manually is:

## 🎯 Features

✅ Class-wise timetable generation  
✅ Intelligent constraint-based logic  
✅ Real-time editing and re-generation  
✅ Print-ready **PDF exports** (single/all classes)  
✅ Cross-device responsive UI  
✅ Secure login with Clerk  
✅ Fast and reliable backend engine  

## 📌 Supported Constraints

- **One Teacher per Slot:** A teacher cannot be in two places at once  
- **Subject Period Limits:** Each subject gets its allotted number of periods per week  
- **Daily Subject Cap:** A subject doesn’t appear more than twice per day  
- **Lab Blocks:** Subjects like IT are automatically grouped into double periods  
- **Class Teacher Priority:** First period of the day is allotted to the class teacher
